## Before you begin
> **Note**
> Each ansible role has a general and a specific Readme file. It is encouraged to read them before firing off
> 
> p.s: Start with the readme file of main setup playbook
* Create an Api on hetzner
* Create a server as terraform and ansible provisioner (Needless to say that ansible and terraform must be installed)
* Clone the project
* In modular_terraform folder create a terraform.tfvars 
    - The file must contain the following variables
      - hcloud_token "APIKEY"
      - image_name = "ubuntu-22.04"
      - server_type = "cpx31"
      - location = "hel1"
* Run terraform init to create the required lock file
* Before firing off, run terraform plan to see if everything is alright
* Run terraform apply
* Go Drink a cup of coffe and come back in 10 minutes or so (Hopefully everything must be up and running by then (: )


## Known issues
* No proper dashbaords for redis are being preloaded dashboards
* No automation for scaling or maintenance
* No audit logging (to see when,who made what changes on the cluster)
* Terraform is limited to Hetzner
* Grafana datasource must be set manually <http://IP_ADDRESS_:8428>




## Work flow
* Run the following command for terraform to install dependencies and create the lock file
``` bash
terraform init
```

* Run the following command and check if there are any problems with terraform
``` bash
terraform plan
```
![image](https://s3.ir-thr-at1.arvanstorage.ir/kangredis/redis_terraform_plan.gif)

* Apply terraform modules and get started
``` bash
terraform apply
```
![image](https://s3.ir-thr-at1.arvanstorage.ir/kangredis/redis_terraform_apply.gif)


* Check the Redis cluster
``` bash
redis-cli -c -h localhost -p 7000 -a "YOUR_PASSWORD" 
```

* Check if Grafana works
* > **Note**
> All dashboard are provisioned 
> To add custom dashbaord on load, add it to /Ansible/roles/Victoria_Metrics/files/Grafana/provisioning/dashboards as a .json file. It would automatically be loaded to Grafana
> Just keep in mind that you have to also copy the dashbaord using ansible to the remote destination

* To Clean up everything (including the nodes themselvs)
``` bash
terraform destroy
```
